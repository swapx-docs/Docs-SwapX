## 🔄 Basic Concepts of Swap

Understanding the core mechanisms of SwapX will help you navigate decentralized trading more effectively.

***

### What is SwapX? The Automated Market Maker (AMM)

**SwapX is an Automated Market Maker (AMM).** An AMM is a type of Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that facilitates trading automatically using smart contracts and mathematical algorithms, rather than relying on traditional buyer/seller **order books**.

* **Pricing:** Transaction prices are determined by a mathematical formula (most commonly the **constant product formula: $x \* y = k$**).
* **Trading:** Users trade directly with a shared pool of assets called the **Liquidity Pool**.
* **Key Features:** SwapX is **permissionless**, **transparent**, and **censorship-resistant**.

> **Liquidity Providers (LPs):** LPs deposit token pairs into the pool to enable trading. They earn fees from transactions but may face the risk of **Impermanent Loss**.

### Decentralized Exchange (DEX) vs. Centralized Exchange (CEX)

The SwapX Exchange provides functions that support true decentralized trading:

| Feature          | Decentralized Exchange (DEX) - _SwapX_                                    | Centralized Exchange (CEX)                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custody**      | **Non-Custodial** (Users keep private keys/assets).                       | **Custodial** (Users deposit assets to the platform).   |
| **Mechanism**    | **Smart Contracts** and **Automated Market Makers (AMM)** or Order Books. | Platform **Order Book** for matching transactions.      |
| **Intermediary** | **None** (Peer-to-peer via smart contract).                               | Centralized institution manages liquidity and matching. |
| **Settlement**   | Publicly settled on the **Blockchain** (transparent).                     | Settled internally on the platform's private database.  |
| **Limitation**   | Limited by on-chain performance (speed, slippage).                        | Reliance on platform security and trustworthiness.      |

> **SwapX's Advantage:** SwapX allows users to trade **without going through a centralized exchange**. All operations are performed directly through **your own wallet**—you never have to entrust your tokens to us or any third party!

### 💧 The Liquidity Pool

The **Liquidity Pool** is the fundamental engine of any AMM like SwapX.

* **Definition:** It is a **smart contract fund pool** composed of crypto assets deposited by users (LPs).
* **Function:** Used to achieve **automatic transaction pricing** and **instant exchange** of tokens.

> **Crucial Requirement:** You can only exchange tokens if SwapX has **sufficient liquidity**. If no one adds enough liquidity for the token you wish to exchange, trading that asset may become difficult, expensive, or even impossible due to lack of depth.

**How LPs are Rewarded:** By providing liquidity, LPs receive **Liquidity Tokens (LP Tokens)**, which entitle them to a share of the trading fees, ensuring that liquidity remains available for exchange.
