### 🌐 Ecosystem Participants

The SwapX ecosystem primarily consists of three categories of users: Liquidity Providers, Traders, and Developers/Projects.

These categories drive a positive feedback loop, fostering the digital economy by defining a common language through which tokens can be pooled, traded, and utilized.

#### 💧 Liquidity Providers (LPs)

LPs are incentivized to contribute ERC-20 tokens to the common liquidity pools. The LP community is not a homogenous group:

* 😴 Passive LPs: Token holders who wish to passively invest their assets to accrue trading fees over time.
* 👩‍💼 Professional LPs: Those who employ market making as a primary strategy. They often develop custom tools and methodologies to track liquidity positions across various DeFi projects.
* 🏗️ Token Projects: Projects that choose to become LPs to create a liquid market for their token. This eases buying and selling and unlocks interoperability with other DeFi projects via SwapX.
* 🧪 DeFi Pioneers: Individuals exploring complex liquidity provision interactions, such as incentivized liquidity, using liquidity as collateral, and other experimental strategies. SwapX is a perfect protocol for projects to try such ideas.

***

#### 💱 Traders

Traders leverage the liquidity extracted from the SwapX protocol. Several classes of traders interact with the ecosystem:

* 📈 Speculators: Users who exchange tokens using various community-built tools and products, betting on price movements.
*   🤖 Arbitrage Bots: Robots that seek profit by exploiting price differences across different platforms.

    > _Note: While their motive is profit, these bots actually help balance prices across the wider Ethereum market, maintaining fairness._
* 📱 DApp Users: Users who purchase tokens on SwapX for use in other applications on Ethereum.
* 🧠 Smart Contracts: Contracts that execute trades on the protocol by implementing swap functionality (ranging from DEX aggregators to custom Solidity scripts).

> Fee Structure: In all cases, trades on the protocol are subject to the same fixed 0.3% fee (which goes to the LPs). Every single fee is important for promoting price accuracy and incentivizing liquidity.

#### 💻 Developers / Projects

The ways SwapX can be applied in the broader Ethereum ecosystem are countless. Some notable examples include:

* 🎨 UX Experiments & Frontends: SwapX's open-source and accessible nature means a plethora of user experience experiments and frontends are available. You can find SwapX functionality in most major DeFi dashboard projects, alongside many SwapX-specific tools built by the community.
* 💼 Wallets: Wallets frequently incorporate swap and liquidity provision functionality as core features of their product.
* 📊 DEX Aggregators: These products source liquidity from many liquidity protocols, splitting trades to provide the best possible price to traders. SwapX is one of the largest single sources of decentralized liquidity for these projects.
* 🛠️ New DeFi Tools: Smart contract developers utilize the available feature suite to invent new DeFi tools and various other experimental ideas. Examples include projects like [Unisocks](https://www.google.com/search?q=insert-link-to-unisocks-if-applicable\&authuser=3) or [Zora](https://www.google.com/search?q=insert-link-to-zora-if-applicable\&authuser=3).
* 🤝 SwapX Team & Community: The SwapX team works alongside the broader community to drive the evolution of the protocol and its ecosystem.
