# Brand & Logos



### 📜 Introduction

SwapX logo downloads are at the bottom of this page, but please be sure to read these guidelines first.

Although SwapX distributes some of its technology under open-source licenses, the **SwapX brand** is not distributed under the same licenses.

The following SwapX "**Brand Assets**" are copyrighted material, and you may only use them in accordance with the policy detailed below:

* The SwapX logos, wordmark, icon
* The SwapX name
* Other visual assets produced by SwapX including but not limited to illustrations and 3d models

***

### ✅ What You May Do

You may use SwapX's Brand Assets when you are:

👌 Referring to our products and services. 👌 Linking to our official site or products, such as "Trade our token on SwapX". 👌 Announcing an official partnership, but only if you have official approval by a qualified member of the SwapX team.

For information on other uses of our Brand Assets, please reach out at **info@swapx.com**.

### ⛔ What You May Not Do

While we strongly believe in and follow the open-source ethos, protecting the SwapX brand is extremely important for our users' security, so that users know what is a genuine product/endorsement and what isn't.

Here are a few examples of **forbidden uses** of our Brand Assets:

⛔️ **Don't use our Brand Assets in your products' name, logo, NFTs, etc.**

* For example, making an app called "SwapX Engine" or "SwapX Child" is not allowed.
* Don't use the SwapX logo in whole or in part as part of your products' logos, marketing material, website, or other.
* Logos with a strong resemblence to the SwapX Icon are also forbidden.

⛔️ **Don't use our Brand Assets to create digital or physical products for sale**, including but not limited to:

* Merchandise ("Swag")
* NFTs
* Other products

⛔️ **Don't create derivative names that imply official endorsement.**

* For example, don't make a social media group called "SwapX Italy" - this sounds official. "SwapX Fans of Italy" may be permitted.

⛔️ **Don't change or adapt our Brand Assets in any way.**

* Use the logos and other assets exactly as provided. Do not change the colors, reassemble, abbreviate, or change these assets in any way.

Use your common sense and creativity. If you want to make something relating to the SwapX ecosystem, make it your own.

Have fun making a unique brand that's clearly yours -- if your product is strong, you won't need to rely on remixing SwapX's brand.
