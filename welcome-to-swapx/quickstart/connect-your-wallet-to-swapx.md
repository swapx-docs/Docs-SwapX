# 🔗connect  your wallet to SwapX

## 👛 How to Connect and Use Your Wallet

This guide covers setting up your wallet with the Xone network and acquiring the necessary gas (XOC) to interact with [SwapX](https://swapx.exchange/).

### ⛽ Get Gas Fees (XOC)

To perform any transaction or interact with smart contracts on [Xone Chain](https://docs.xone.org/study/xone), you must use XOC tokens to pay for gas fees.

#### What is XOC?

{% hint style="info" %}
XOC is the native cryptocurrency of **Xone Chain**, operating similarly to ETH in the Ethereum ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

Users must use XOC tokens to interact with Xone Chain, as they are used to pay for gas fees associated with transactions and smart contract interactions.

Additionally, XOC tokens play a vital role in:

* **Network Security:** Users can lock (stake) tokens to help protect the network and receive corresponding rewards.
* **Ecosystem Support:** Providing support for decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and cross-chain applications.
* **Incentives:** Playing an important role in the behavioral value incentive (BVI) economic model.

#### How to get XOC

You can acquire XOC through several methods:

* **🛒 Buy on Exchanges:** XOC can be purchased on various centralized exchanges (CEX), where users can exchange XOC with fiat or other cryptocurrencies.
  * _(It is recommended to store XOC in a wallet that you control for enhanced security.)_
* **🔒 Earn XOC through Staking:** Users can stake XOC to maintain network security and receive staking rewards. You can delegate XOC to a staking provider or run a validation node to earn XOC rewards.
* **🌉 Cross-chain Asset Transfer:** XOC supports cross-chain asset transfer. You can introduce assets (like ETH and USDT) into Xone Chain, exchange them for XOC, or use them within the Xone Chain ecosystem.
* **🎉 Participate in Community Activities:** Users can also earn XOC by participating in Xone Chain ecosystem activities, such as hackathons, developer challenges, and airdrops.

### 🌐 Add Xone Network Information

Before you can use XOC or interact with SwapX on Xone Chain, you must add the network to your wallet.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Xone Mainnet Details**

* **Network Name:** Xone Mainnet
* **RPC URL:** `https://rpc.xone.org`
* **Chain ID:** 3721 (0xe89)
* **Symbol:** XOC
* **Block Browser URL:** `https://xscscan.com/`
{% endhint %}

#### Use in Wallet (Example: Metamask)

Let's start with Metamask as an example:

**Step 1:** Open your Metamask network extension.&#x20;

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

**Step 2:** Click the network button in the upper left corner and click "Add custom network".&#x20;

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

**Step 3:** After adding the network, you can recharge (deposit) XOC for the mainnet.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

{% hint style="warning" %}
All our chain operations require gas fees! All wallets must add the Xone mainnet before they can continue.
{% endhint %}

**Step 4:** Now let's go to **SwapX**, connect the wallet to open a new world of swap.
